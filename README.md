# Financial Data Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing financial data using Python and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Yahoo Finance (yfinance).

## Overview

In this project, we use Python to analyze financial data related to stock prices, specifically focusing on the period around the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrieve stock data using the `yfinance` library and perform various analyses and visualizations.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main components:

1. `main.py`: The main Python script containing the code for data retrieval, analysis, and visualization.
2. `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
3. Jupyter Notebooks: (optional) Additional notebooks for specific analyses or visualizations.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- datetime
- yfinance
- matplotlib
- pandas_datareader

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy datetime yfinance matplotlib pandas_datareader
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed (see Requirements).
3. Run the `main.py` script to execute the project.

## Functionality

- Retrieving stock data using the Yahoo Finance API.
- Analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 related stock price trends.
- Visualizing trading volume for a specific stock.
- Plotting stock price and volume on the same chart.

## Acknowledgments

This project was created for educational purposes to demonstrate data analysis and visualization using Python libraries. The stock data used is for demonstration purposes only.
